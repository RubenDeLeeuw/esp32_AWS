### Creating a Thing

We start bij creating a thing. you can do this by going to https://us-west-2.console.aws.amazon.com/console/home?region=us-west-2#. go to IoT core => lanege => thing. And create a new thing.  The name  is not important but make sure you remember it.  When your thing is created you create a new certificate for this thing and download the 3 keys you are given, put these in a safe place where you can find them easily back becuase we need them later and if you lose them you need to create a thing again. 

### .ino Code

Once you have done this open the .ino file from this project. next you create a secrets.h file in the same folder according to the example found. now we need the keys we got earlier when we created our thing. Open the keys in a texteditor like notepad and copy them. put them on the right place in the code and once you placed all the keys on the right place in the code you can upload them.

### Creating S3 Bucket

Now were going to make a s3 bucket for our thing. go to s3 => bucket and create here a new bucket. Choose the same server as youre thing.
go back to AWS IoT and in act got ot rules here you have to add a new rule. choose a rule name and change the topic to the topi in youre .ino code. next you need to add an action. select store message in amazon s3 bucket. then choose your bucket from the previous step and as key I choose data/${device_id}_${topic()}/${timestamp()}. the data you send should now appear in your bucket.

# cloud api

now were going to create an EC2 virtual machine on aws to store our data. I used an ubuntu server with the t2 micro tear because this one is the cheapest. You don't have to change much in the first 5 steps but notice in the 6th step you have to add http and https. After completing the last step generate a key, give it a name and **download** it. . now open PuTTYgen choose the key you recently downloaded and load it. Now go back to aws EC2 where you can find the ip address of your virtual machine. Now open up PuTTY select ssh as connection type and put in the IP you just got from AWS. 


### Ubuntu

Before you can open the connection on the left side you see a menu here go into ssh and click on auth here click browse and select the file you got from PuTTYgen. now you should be able to open a connection using the open button.

Now you login with the username ubuntu.

Were going to do some commands to update/download everything and soon creating our first mysql database.

Now start by doing the **'sudo apt-get update'** and **'sudo apt-get upgrade'**

When this is finished, do the following commands to get an apache server running and a database.

**'sudo apt install apache2'**

**'sudo apt install mysql-server'**

**'sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql'** 

**'sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html'** 

**'sudo systemctl restart apache2'** 

**'sudo apt install certbot'** 

**'sudo apt install python3-certbot-apache'**

### Mysql Database

**'sudo mysql'**

now you have entered the mysql command line now follow these steps (can also be found in the sql.txt file) everything in [] should be changed to something of your choice. do remember these because we will be needing them for your secrets file.

CREATE DATABASE [DATABASENAME];

CREATE USER '[USERNAME]'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '[PASSWORD]';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON [DATABASENAME].* TO '[USERNAME]'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

USE [DATABASENAME];

CREATE TABLE esp32 (
ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
Device_id VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
Temperature Float,
Humidity Float,
Datetime DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

quit

Now you have made a database for your data to test if this was done correctly, copy/create the test.php and mysql_connect.php from the cloud_api folder to the /var/www/html directory. In this same directory you create a secrets.php from the example_secrets in the cloud_api.

Now in your web browser you can test if this works by surfing to your ip followed by /test.php.

Now to make your connection https instead of http you need to create an account on the noip https://www.noip.com/. Here we create a dns for your ip by clicking the create hostname button. After choosing the best hostname click on it in the no-ip hostname list and putting in your virtual machine ip as the destination. Do take notice that if your machine is closed you will have to do this step gain if you want this domain to keep on working. To solve this follow this link: https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/installing-the-linux-dynamic-update-client-on-ubuntu/ (sudo apt install make & gcc)

Now to actually get certified we need to use certbot just use the ‘sudo certbot --apache’ command and fill in your information and at the end select option 2 to force everyone to use https.

Now for the finishing touches add the api.php file and list.php files to the var/www/html folder.

To now make aws send your data to the correct location go back to the rule we made in part 1 and add a new action to this rule a http action withe as link your very amazing link followed by /api.php. and three headers withe the keys: device_id, temperature and humidity and values: ${devide_id}, ${temperature} and ${humidity} respectively.

Now go to destinations and add the api.php link here aswell and to enable it add the api token found using the sudo tail /var/log/apache2/access.log command.

Now by opening your site followed by list.php you should see your esp32 data.

part 3 visualization
Now that we have our data on the device we want to display it using grafana and we want to know how our virtual machine is doing using telegraf.

influxdb
First install infuxdb as our database.

sudo curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -

then add and influx data repository

source /etc/lsb-release echo "deb https://repos.influxdata.com/${DISTRIB_ID,,} ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list

now update the package list and install influxdb

sudo apt update sudo apt install influxdb -y

Now to launch influxdb on boot start the influxdb service.

sudo systemctl start influxdb sudo systemctl enable influxdb

to see if influxdb is running correctly do:

netstat -plntu

if in this list port 8088 and 8086 are in a LISTEN state it is running.

now create a user and database this is about the same as we did in mysql.

you start with the influx command

infux

to connect on the 8086 port now you start by creating a database and user for the telegraf client.

create database telegraf create user telegraf with password 'hakase-ndlr'

To make sure these have been created use:

show databases show users

Here you will see the database name telegraf and user name telegraf in you list.

telegraf
To install telegraf.

sudo apt install telegraf -y

Now again we want telegraf to start on boot so we start the telegraf service.

sudo systemctl start telegraf sudo systemctl enable telegraf

To check if telegraf actualy started, execute.

sudo systemctl status telegraf

the basics of telegraf is that it has 4 plugin types namely: 1 Using the 'Input Plugins' to collect metrics. 2 Using the 'Processor Plugins' to transform, decorate, and filter metrics. 3 Using the 'Aggregator Plugins' to create and aggregate metrics. 4 And using the 'Output Plugins' to write metrics to various destinations. We are going to use the 1ste type of plugin where you use telegraf to collect system metrics and 4the type to get the metrics to influxdb.

First we make a backup of the telegraf.conf file to restore the original configuration incase of mistakes.

cd /etc/telegraf/ mv telegraf.conf telegraf.conf.default

now remove the original telegraf.conf

rm telegraf.conf

now create a new telegraf.conf using nano or your editor of choice and past the data found in the telegraf.txt file on the github in the grafana folder.

nano telegraf.conf

now restart telegraf

sudo systemctl restart telegraf

And test if it worked by using these 3 commands

sudo telegraf -test -config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf --input-filter cpu sudo telegraf -test -config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf --input-filter net sudo telegraf -test -config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf --input-filter mem

If this still gives you rerrors you can retry or configure telegraf via the command manager.

telegraf config -input-filter cpu:mem:disk:swap:system -output-filter influxdb > telegraf.conf cat telegraf.conf

grafana
To install grafana this could be an outdated method by now so make sure to check the tutorial by grafana https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/debian/. In this case we are using grafana enterprise. first do

sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

then do: echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/enterprise/deb stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list

to get the latest stable release. and now for the actual installation using apt now that grafana is in the package list.

sudo apt update sudo apt install grafana-enterprise

Now again we want grafana to run as a service as well so we use the commands:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl start grafana-server sudo systemctl status grafana-server sudo systemctl enable grafana-server.service

now go back to aws and here we have to open the port 3000 to the world in order to access grafana from other devices. To do this go to ec2 on aws and in instances klick on your instance now at the bottom there is a window with the instance details. Here you click on security then on the link under the title security groups. This link will bring you to the launch wizard for your security. Here you click on edit inbound rules and add a custom TCP rule for the port 3000 and with the course 0.0.0.0/0.

Once the port is open you can surf to you ip flowed by the port 3000 to go to the grafana interface here you add mysql as your data source. to do more things in grafana ia would suggest looking up an actual tutorial or trying sommething like this https://docs.alfresco.com/sync-service/3.1/admin/monitor/grafana/.

part 4 lambda
Now we want to control the led we have on our esp32 which has not been used up until this point. To do this we will use lambda on aws to create a function in python that listens to our mqtt service and turns the light on in case the temperature is too high.

To create a lambda function go to the compute section on aws and select lambda. in functions you click create function. Normally ‘author from scratch’ is selected, if not select this then you can fill in the name of this function and in runtime select python, the version doesn't really matter.

Now you should see an add trigger button click here and select AWS IoT then select custom IoT rule and existing rule. Now you should be able to select the rule we made before to send the data from iot to the bucket and the api on the virtual machine also make sure to select the enable trigger that will make your life easier. Now to actually make the function useful you should add the code found in de lmada folder in the AWS IoT file to the lambda_funtion.py file on aws and editing the led topic to your own and correcting the server to the one you are on now.

#esp32MQTTonAWS

to make this project you will need: activated AWS account, esp32 and a dht11/22

In aws IoT we start by creating a thing in the manage things tab. The name of this thing is not important just see that you remember it. In the next step you can ignore most of the things there. Afterwards you create a new certificate for this thing and download the 3 keys you are given and put these in a safe place. These could put your data at risk if you give them to anyone.

Click on the activate button below and the download link for the root CA for AWS IoT there you will need to get the amazon root CA 1.

Once you have done this open the .ino file from this project. In this file you should not change a thing. Unless you want to change the used pins or the dht type. then in the same folder you create a secrets.h file according to the example found. the topics there refer to a topic on the mqtt server and will decide where your data will be stored. after including all the information we are gonna need the keys we got earlier when creating our thing, these can just be opened in notepad. The first key is the last key we downloaded and should have a name with root and ca 1 in it. The second will have certificata.perm.crt.txt in its name. the last will have private perm in the name. one you filled these in you can upload the code.

If this works you will get an AWS IoT connected! message on your serial monitor.

Now on AWS go to the S3 section and here we are going to make a bucket for this you just choose and the server to store the bucket at the smartest choice here is to use the same server as the one where your thing is located.

now go back to AWS IoT and in act got ot rules here you have to add a new rule here you choose a rule name and in the select * from you change the iot/topic to the before chosen mqtt topic in your secrets.h. After this go to add action here you select store message in amazon s3 bucket. then choose your bucket from the previous step and as key I choose data/${device_id}_${topic()}/${timestamp()}. and the role I gave is AWSIOT_S3_FULL. the data you send should now appear in your bucket.

part 2 cloud api
Now we are storing the data on a bucket yet this is not ideal so now create an EC2 virtual machine on aws. In my application I used an ubuntu server with the t2 micro tear this is one of the verry cheap tears and even free if you play your cards right. The rest you can mostly ignore except for the 6ste step here you have to add http and https (port 80 and 443 do not remove the port 22 connection). After clicking confirm you have the option to add a pair key or use an existing one the safest option is to generate a new one. So just give it a name and download your freshly generated key. don’t forget to download it else there is no easy way to recover it. Ifi things still are as when i did it you now have an outdated key with a different extension then .ppk if you did get a ppk file you don’t have to do this next strep. First you have to download PuTTY and open PuTTYgen one you open PuTTYgen your klick load and open the key file you just got. It will give you some warnings just ignore them and continue. Now save this key under the same name as the previous key. Now go back to aws EC2 where you can find the ip address of your virtual machine. Now open up PuTTY select ssh as connection type and put in the IP you just got from AWS. Before you can open the connection on the left side you see a menu here go into ssh and click on auth here click browse and select the file you got from PuTTYgen. now you should be able to open a connection using the open button.

Now you login with the username ubuntu.

Now start by doing the sudo apt-get update and upgrade

When this is finished, do the following commands to get an apache server running and a database.

sudo apt install apache2 sudo apt install mysql-server sudo apt install php libapache2-mod-php php-mysql sudo chmod 777 /var/www/html sudo systemctl restart apache2 sudo apt install certbot sudo apt install python3-certbot-apache

sudo mysql

now you have entered the mysql command line now follow these steps (can also be found in the sql.txt file) everything in [] should be changed to something of your choice. do remember these because we will be needing them for your secrets file.

CREATE DATABASE [DATABASENAME];

CREATE USER '[USERNAME]'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '[PASSWORD]';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON [DATABASENAME].* TO '[USERNAME]'@'localhost';

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;

USE [DATABASENAME];

CREATE TABLE esp32 (
ID INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
Device_id VARCHAR (100) NOT NULL,
Temperature Float,
Humidity Float,
Datetime DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, PRIMARY KEY (ID)
);

quit

Now you have made a database for your data to test if this was done correctly, copy/create the test.php and mysql_connect.php from the cloud_api folder to the /var/www/html directory. In this same directory you create a secrets.php from the example_secrets in the cloud_api.

Now in your web browser you can test if this works by surfing to your ip followed by /test.php.

Now to make your connection https instead of http you need to create an account on the noip https://www.noip.com/. Here we create a dns for your ip by clicking the create hostname button. After choosing the best hostname click on it in the no-ip hostname list and putting in your virtual machine ip as the destination. Do take notice that if your machine is closed you will have to do this step gain if you want this domain to keep on working. To solve this follow this link: https://www.noip.com/support/knowledgebase/installing-the-linux-dynamic-update-client-on-ubuntu/ (sudo apt install make & gcc)

Now to actually get certified we need to use certbot just use the ‘sudo certbot --apache’ command and fill in your information and at the end select option 2 to force everyone to use https.

Now for the finishing touches add the api.php file and list.php files to the var/www/html folder.

To now make aws send your data to the correct location go back to the rule we made in part 1 and add a new action to this rule a http action withe as link your very amazing link followed by /api.php. and three headers withe the keys: device_id, temperature and humidity and values: ${devide_id}, ${temperature} and ${humidity} respectively.

Now go to destinations and add the api.php link here aswell and to enable it add the api token found using the sudo tail /var/log/apache2/access.log command.

Now by opening your site followed by list.php you should see your esp32 data.

part 3 visualization
Now that we have our data on the device we want to display it using grafana and we want to know how our virtual machine is doing using telegraf.

influxdb
First install infuxdb as our database.

sudo curl -sL https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key | sudo apt-key add -

then add and influx data repository

source /etc/lsb-release echo "deb https://repos.influxdata.com/${DISTRIB_ID,,} ${DISTRIB_CODENAME} stable" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/influxdb.list

now update the package list and install influxdb

sudo apt update sudo apt install influxdb -y

Now to launch influxdb on boot start the influxdb service.

sudo systemctl start influxdb sudo systemctl enable influxdb

to see if influxdb is running correctly do:

netstat -plntu

if in this list port 8088 and 8086 are in a LISTEN state it is running.

now create a user and database this is about the same as we did in mysql.

you start with the influx command

infux

to connect on the 8086 port now you start by creating a database and user for the telegraf client.

create database telegraf create user telegraf with password 'hakase-ndlr'

To make sure these have been created use:

show databases show users

Here you will see the database name telegraf and user name telegraf in you list.

telegraf
To install telegraf.

sudo apt install telegraf -y

Now again we want telegraf to start on boot so we start the telegraf service.

sudo systemctl start telegraf sudo systemctl enable telegraf

To check if telegraf actualy started, execute.

sudo systemctl status telegraf

the basics of telegraf is that it has 4 plugin types namely: 1 Using the 'Input Plugins' to collect metrics. 2 Using the 'Processor Plugins' to transform, decorate, and filter metrics. 3 Using the 'Aggregator Plugins' to create and aggregate metrics. 4 And using the 'Output Plugins' to write metrics to various destinations. We are going to use the 1ste type of plugin where you use telegraf to collect system metrics and 4the type to get the metrics to influxdb.

First we make a backup of the telegraf.conf file to restore the original configuration incase of mistakes.

cd /etc/telegraf/ mv telegraf.conf telegraf.conf.default

now remove the original telegraf.conf

rm telegraf.conf

now create a new telegraf.conf using nano or your editor of choice and past the data found in the telegraf.txt file on the github in the grafana folder.

nano telegraf.conf

now restart telegraf

sudo systemctl restart telegraf

And test if it worked by using these 3 commands

sudo telegraf -test -config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf --input-filter cpu sudo telegraf -test -config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf --input-filter net sudo telegraf -test -config /etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf --input-filter mem

If this still gives you rerrors you can retry or configure telegraf via the command manager.

telegraf config -input-filter cpu:mem:disk:swap:system -output-filter influxdb > telegraf.conf cat telegraf.conf

grafana
To install grafana this could be an outdated method by now so make sure to check the tutorial by grafana https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/installation/debian/. In this case we are using grafana enterprise. first do

sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common wget wget -q -O - https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key | sudo apt-key add -

then do: echo "deb https://packages.grafana.com/enterprise/deb stable main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/grafana.list

to get the latest stable release. and now for the actual installation using apt now that grafana is in the package list.

sudo apt update sudo apt install grafana-enterprise

Now again we want grafana to run as a service as well so we use the commands:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload sudo systemctl start grafana-server sudo systemctl status grafana-server sudo systemctl enable grafana-server.service

now go back to aws and here we have to open the port 3000 to the world in order to access grafana from other devices. To do this go to ec2 on aws and in instances klick on your instance now at the bottom there is a window with the instance details. Here you click on security then on the link under the title security groups. This link will bring you to the launch wizard for your security. Here you click on edit inbound rules and add a custom TCP rule for the port 3000 and with the course 0.0.0.0/0.

Once the port is open you can surf to you ip flowed by the port 3000 to go to the grafana interface here you add mysql as your data source. to do more things in grafana ia would suggest looking up an actual tutorial or trying sommething like this https://docs.alfresco.com/sync-service/3.1/admin/monitor/grafana/.

part 4 lambda
Now we want to control the led we have on our esp32 which has not been used up until this point. To do this we will use lambda on aws to create a function in python that listens to our mqtt service and turns the light on in case the temperature is too high.

To create a lambda function go to the compute section on aws and select lambda. in functions you click create function. Normally ‘author from scratch’ is selected, if not select this then you can fill in the name of this function and in runtime select python, the version doesn't really matter.

Now you should see an add trigger button click here and select AWS IoT then select custom IoT rule and existing rule. Now you should be able to select the rule we made before to send the data from iot to the bucket and the api on the virtual machine also make sure to select the enable trigger that will make your life easier. Now to actually make the function useful you should add the code found in de lmada folder in the AWS IoT file to the lambda_funtion.py file on aws and editing the led topic to your own and correcting the server to the one you are on now.

Now as an extra you can add another function this time using API gateway as a trigger to turn the led on and off using a url. for this the code can be found in the api file in the lambda folder. Then just surf to the given url followed by "?led=1" or "?led=0" to turn the led on and off this could then also be used to make a button in grafana.
